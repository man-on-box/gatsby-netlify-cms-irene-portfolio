The wine industry is a traditional one. Most people would present wines to their customers in hotels, restaurants or conference centers.

We had to present our new products to our independent retail customers- most of them owners of local wine shops- so doing it in a formal restaurant didn't seem appropriate. Instead, and following the independent philosophy of our customers we decided to host our tasting in a market. A traditional one, where people would go to buy fresh vegetables, meat or fish. It was an informal tasting with a great atmosphere and where customers felt free to explore the products, in the same way they would do in a market.
