We decided to host our London autumn tasting in a bookshop in London.

The creative collateral produced made reference to famous books with a wine tweak, Grape expectations and Wine and Punishment were some of the best seller titles.

In between the tasting and lunch, we offered our customers a voucher they could use in the bookshop.
