Brexit, Trump, Sterling going down against the Euro, the wine prices going up...

How do you present your new portfolio and price list to your customers when you know it's going to be a hard year for them and you're asking them to pay a bit more for your products?

We used the opening sentence of 'A tale of two cities' as an introduction to our portfolio tasting. Not only because it was quite representative of the times we were living, but also because we were presenting our wines in two different cities, Manchester and London.

However, we decided to use this quote as a positive and cheerful message for our customers, because there's always a positive side of things. Every dark cloud always has a silver lining.

We tried to convey this message in all the collateral we produced. Invites, tablecloths, banners and the post-event video followed a similar style, always focusing on the bright side of things.
