Celeste is one of Familia Torres's most famous wine brands.

The grapes from which this wine is made grow at almost 900m above sea level. The high altitude offers the wine fresh fruit and intense aromas.

The label and the storytelling of the brand refer to this magical place in the middle of the mountains where you can see the clearest skies you can ever imagine.

As part of the marketing consumer campaign for Celeste I wanted to take the magic of a starry night in the forest to urban customers in the middle of a city.

With that aim in mind, I organised Noches Celeste (Celeste nights) where consumers could enjoy live music, a specially tailored and magical menu for the night and where they were also guided through different astronomic phenomena thanks to an astronomer provided with a professional telescope.

These events were organised over the course of a year and took place in our main target locations: Madrid, MÃ¡laga, Valencia and Barcelona, achieving great brand awareness, mentions in social media and leisure magazines.
