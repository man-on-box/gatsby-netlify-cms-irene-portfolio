As you must imagine, my name is Irene. I've always loved puzzles. I am the kind of person who would spend hours and hours finishing a crossword, finding the answer of a riddle or trying to figure out a formula in Excel that does exactly what I want.​

For me marketing is all about solving puzzles. Everything starts with a brief, a situation or a problem that needs to be addressed and it is for marketeers to draw the path to find the perfect solution and meet the required objectives. As always, the more tools you have, the easier it will be to solve the puzzle.

During my career I have worked in many different project and companies, from graphic design, to event management, digital project management, trade marketing and brand management.

This experience has given me a very wide understanding of different marketing tools and industries and therefore, I can develop innovative marketing solutions based on totally different needs.

If you want to know a bit more about me you and how I can help to build your brand, don't be shy, please say hi at [galvezirene@gmail.com.](<mailto:galvezirene@gmail.com?subject=Hi!, Hola!>)

Or you can always be nosy and have a look at my [LinkedIn profile.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irenegalvez/)

### Shade-grown coffee

Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
