As you must imagine, my name is Irene. I've always loved puzzles. I am the kind of person who would spend hours and hours finishing a crossword, finding the answer of a riddle or trying to figure out a formula in Excel that does exactly what I want.​

For me marketing is all about solving puzzles. Everything starts with a brief, a situation or a problem that needs to be addressed and it is for marketeers to draw the path to find the perfect solution and meet the required objectives. As always, the more tools you have, the easier it will be to solve the puzzle.

During my career I have worked in many different project and companies, from graphic design, to event management, digital project management, trade marketing and brand management.

This experience has given me a very wide understanding of different marketing tools and industries and therefore, I can develop innovative marketing solutions based on totally different needs.

If you want to know a bit more about me you and how I can help to build your brand, don't be shy, please say hi at [galvezirene@gmail.com.](<mailto:galvezirene@gmail.com?subject=Hi!, Hola!>)
